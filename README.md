I'm a bigenner I'm passionate about protecting systems,and breaking into things writing clean and efficient code, and finding vulnerabilities that others overlook. Whether it's competing in CTF challenges or building complex web applications, I'm always pushing my limits.

    🔭 I work with tools across Cybersecurity and Web Development:
        🛠️ MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
        🐍 Python: Automation, Scripting, Security Tools,Django,Flask
        🕸️ Web Exploitation: XSS, SQL Injection, Subdomain Enumeration
        🔓 Bug Bounties: Actively hunting for vulnerabilities and reporting them responsibly.
        🎯 CTF Player: Competing in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges regularly.
        🛠️ Tools: Nmap, Burp Suite, Amass, Sublist3r, GF, Metasploit, OWASP ZAP ..

    🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering.
